## What is the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)?
The C2PA is a [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) project to collectively build an end-to-end open technical standard to provide publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media.

## What is content provenance?
Provenance refers to the basic, trustworthy facts about the origins of a piece of digital content (image, video, audio recording, document) including who created it and how, when, and where it was created or edited. 

## What makes content provenance a better solution to address misinformation?
Detecting whether or not digital content is fake is currently impossible at internet scale and speed because manipulation software is increasingly more sophisticated, metadata can easily be manipulated and provides no proof of its origins. 

## Which companies are part of C2PA?
The C2PA was founded February 2021 by Microsoft and Adobe and includes Arm, BBC, Intel, and Truepic.

## When will C2PA deliver the technical standard?
C2PA is targeting 2021 to deliver technical standards for content provenance and authenticity.
